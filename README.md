Welcome to the Responsive Solar System Showcase!

I developed this site using basic HTML and CSS to create an interactive and educational experience for exploring the planets of our solar system. It's a place where you can learn about the fascinating characteristics of each planet and enjoy beautiful visuals.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the content and ensuring a semantic layout.

CSS: For styling the site and implementing responsive design through media queries to make it visually appealing on all devices.

About the Project:

This project was created to enhance my web development skills and to provide an engaging platform for anyone interested in astronomy. By incorporating CSS media queries, I ensured that the site adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, offering a user-friendly experience whether you're on a desktop or smartphone.
